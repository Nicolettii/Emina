# Enima (Django Web Project)
Enima was an old school project developed for the academic subject "Projeto de Interfaces para Web" in collaboration with @KagariDali. At the time, Enima consisted only of a set of static web pages with an interface inspired by Reddit.

With the goal of learning and applying Django, the project has been repurposed and transformed into a dynamic web application.
